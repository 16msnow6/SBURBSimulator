<h1> FAQ </h1>

<ul>

	<li> <b>How do I contact you?</b><br><br>
			  My Tumblr is <a href = "https://jadedresearcher.tumblr.com/">here</a> and apparently that has an email address of jadedResearcher@yahoo.com. <Br><Br> And I just made a google account (jadedResearcher@gmail.com) for hosting PDFs of <a href = "https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-uS7ImZMoISSmxFeVlUM09XUnc">amazing sessions </a> for posterity. <font color = "white"> And also this amazingly shitty colab brainstorming spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WxeH77-Mtenq9iQRNVBiSyoJNBvTXpHaaVqiXJZ_5Yg/edit?usp=sharing</font>
	</li>
	<br><Br>
	
	<li> <b>Do I have to know how to hack to get that password?</b><br><br>
			  Nope! You ALSO don't even need to know Homestuck trivia.  The password is 100% contained within this site, in places regular people can (and probably have) accessed.  What is the password? You gotta figure it out yourself. Hence the myserty. <font color = "white"> Although if you REALLY want a hint, I can say that even *I* don't know the password. But I know how to have AuthorBot help me find it. </font>
			  <br><Br>
			  And if you didn't even know there WAS a password, well, all I can say is: keep your eyes peeled for [???] links.
	</li>
	<br><Br>

	<li> <b>Is there a way to save/share my session?</b><br><br>
			  The "Shareable URL" link will always display the session you're currently in. If you send that link to a friend, they will see your same session!
			  <br><br>	<a href = "index2.html?seed=413612">Here is an example!</a>
			  <br><br>
			  Well...I mean, as long as I haven't updated the code any. If I'm adding features or squashing bugs, the url will go to a slightly different session. If it's REALLY important that your session is saved, you can always print the page to a PDF.  Most modern browsers have a "print to pdf" option inside the print menu. I've had success doing that.  Make sure your session is actually done, of course, or you'll be missing the ending.
	</li>
	<br><Br>

	<li> <b>The simulation isn't working!</b><Br><br>

		  First, make sure your browser is compatible with HTML5 canvas images. Try the <a href = "oc_generator.html">OC Generator</a>, as it uses the same rendering engine, but on a much smaller scale.  If you see things like Interests and Chat Handles, good news: Your browser is just slow and is taking awhile to download the images, but it IS compatible with HTML5 canvases (the text is a canvas on that page as well as the sprites). Refreshing the page a few times should get the images into your cache and speed things up. If you see nothing but drop down menus and check boxes, your browser does not support HTML5 canvases. Sorry.

		  <Br><br>
		  Okay, if the <a href = "oc_generator.html">OC Generator</a> is working good for you, but the simulation still isn't: We have found a bug.  It could be a small bug that only happens in the one session (gotta feel bad for those players), but it could also be a huge bug that effects EVERY session for your browswer. Refresh the page a time or two and see if you ever see anything.  If you don't, please let me know what browser you're using (both the name and the version number) and I'll see if I can track that huge bug down. Also include the "Shareable URL" created at the top of your session.
		  <Br><Br>
		  You can probably still view the <a href = "index.html">1.0 sim</a>, though. And if you can't even see THAT, then we REALLY have a problem.
		  </li>
	</li>
<br><br>
	<li> <b>No, I mean I think you broke the sim. For, like, everybody. </b>
			<br><Br> Shit.  I do that sometimes. Mostly it happens when I'm testing some complex feature and I manage to get IT working, but don't think to do more generic tests.  The <a href = "rare_session_finder.html"> AuthorBot </a> helps me out a TON by running a bunch of sessions at once, but even she can't help me find subtle bugs that aren't console errors. (I was up past midnight last night, for example, figuring out why scratch buttons weren't rendering anymore. AuthorBot hadn't noticed AT ALL. She is still the best. <3)
	</li>
	<br><br>
	<li> <b>I think I found a bug!</b><br><br>
			 I welcome bug reports (see above for how to contact me), but just be warned that not every bug is a priority for me. Or even something I consider a bug? Shenanigans are my favorite hand-wavey explanation for why things happened weirdly.  For example, on the rare occasion that a corpse texts someone, I just imagine them tragically texting their best friend as they bleed out from Jack-related stabbings. Of course, sometimes corpses are a BIT more lively than that, fighting bosses and corpse smooching other corpses. That's probably a bug.  Use your judgement.
			 <br><br>
			 When you give me a bug report, please include the "shareable url". This will let me review your session directly.  ALSO, you are totally free to submit the bug report as a roleplay as the character from the session (as long as you give me a shareable URL I can put what you type into the character's quirk for extra realism (So you don't have to try to match their quirk)) .  I'm collecting the best bugs into my own <a href = "glitches.html"> Glitch FAQ</a>.
	</li>
	<br><Br>

	<li> <b>I think I found a typo!</b><br><br>
			 Okay, but, like, are you SURE it's a typo?  Is it a refrance (which is itself a reference)?  Or is it a character's quirk? This entire thing is an exercise in pissing automatic spellcheckers off. If you're sure it's a typo, feel free to contact me (see above for how to contact me).  For example, somebody pointed out that I had been spelling (and pronouncing!!!) "carapacian" as "carpacian". D'oh!
	</li>
	<br><Br>
	<li> <b>I have a suggestion!</b><br><br>
			Awesome! Let me know (see above for how to contact me), but just be warned that I'm sorta doing this as a hobby.  My primary target audience is myself (and a hypothetical past version of myself who wished something like this existed).  I might think your idea is cool, but be all like: "Yeah, but that sounds HARD! And...kinda...boring to actually code, even if it's awesome in practice?".  Obviously I'm not afraid of hard stuff if I made this sim, but pretty much every part of it has been INTERESTING to implement, you know?  That said, random people have had plenty of good ideas that have worked it's way into the sim.
			<Br><Br>
			In fact, I have now decided that my shitty OC character is OBVIOUSLY a Derse Dreamer, because they are constantly bombarded with the whisperings of the horrorterrors, which in this metaphor is you guys and all your ideas. I'd go CRAZY if I listened TOO hard to all that shit, but as long as it's in moderation it's a source of inspiration. 
	</li>
	<br><Br>

	<li> <b>Did you make all those images yourself?</b><br><br>
			Dammit, Jim, I'm a programmer, not an artist. Wait. What was the question? Oh, right.  No, I'm not a particularly artistic person. You can find a vague credits page for images I found and used <a href ="sources">here</a>. Mostly I found SBURB character creator doll sets and turned them into something I could use programmatically.  My friend, <a href = "art_newsposts.html">karmicRetribution</a>, massaged the images as needed to make them not so derpy.  The wings were a bit more of an original project, since I couldn't find any sprite sheet for them.  For those I fiddled around with canon images and sprites and tried to make them fit the regular sprites, and then karmicRetribution made them less jaggedy and off-center and less obviously canon characters. karmicRetribution ALSO made custom baby/grub sprites. And better non-godtier sprites! And hair!
	</li>
	<br><Br>
	<li> <b>I want to help!</b><br><br>
			Awesome! I have a git repository <a href = "https://github.com/jadedResearcher/SBURBSimulator"> here</a>, but just be warned that I am extremely unlikely to use any non-me-generated code. BUT! This whole thing is under the MIT License and people can use it for whatever as long as they credit me.  Also...you should totally be warned that I made this simulation for speed of development, not ease of modibliity or ease of understanding for non-me-type-people. Good luck!
	</li>
	<br><Br>
	<li><b>What is up with the AuthorBot?</b><br><br>
			I love her!!!  In addition to making my life so much easier, I am just fucking tickled to have this shitty AI assistant with it's own shitty oc image. It's beautiful.
			<br><Br>
				That said, sometimes she goes a little...wonky.  Sometimes the sessions she finds are weird and don't actually correspond to reality at all. (Like gushing about a player that isn't even in the session). Usually at that point I have to figure out where she's eating extra (or sometimes fewer) random seeds. If she stops making sense, drop me a line (see above for how to contact me.)  She's as much code as any of this, so is just as prone to bugs.
	</li>
	<br><Br>
	
	<li><b>No, why is it called 'AuthorBot'?</b><br><br>
			Oh! Well, she's clearly a bot of me, and I am the Author of all of this.  BUT WAIT: THERE'S MORE! So, the main way people interact with AuthorBot is through the rare session finder. And yeah, she is hella good at finding rare sessions.  But maybe it's unclear that she is the AUTHOR of said sessions??? She is literally simulating each session she "finds", and then presenting you with a summary of it.  And she's using/made of the same code that the main story page uses as well. 
			<Br><Br>
			Basically, it's a partnership between me and her.  I create the pieces of the stories, and then program her to assemble them on demand. Sure, I may say "there's an X% chance that Jack finds a rare weapon" and "If Jack is not too much weaker than the Black Queen, he finds a sufficiently 'chump-like' player to scheme with", but that doesn't mean I'm not suprised and delighted by the stories the AuthorBot creates. She is the best <3  I am still getting over how awesome it is that she created a 3x Session Combo all on her own.

	</li>
	<br><Br>
		<li><b>Why is your avatar a Waste of Mind?</b><br><br>
			Mostly for the pun. I create whole artificial minds for pointless shit like simulating a game from a webcomic. Plus, I was pretty enthralled with the fanfiction <a href = "http://archiveofourown.org/works/869819/chapters/1670205">Like One Sundered Star</a> positing that anybody who makes sprawling sburb related works with highly indulgent self-insertions is a Waste. The author was a Waste of Time, specifically. And finally, mind seems to be about decisions and shit, and this simulation is nothing but decisions piled onto decisions rather than actual cognition of any type. (This may be the BIGGEST AI I've made, but it's actually pretty simple. )<br><br>
			Also, now that I've done my GroundHog day shit, it seems all the more appropriate.  What other classpect would provide fourth-wall breaking decisions that completely change a session?

		</li>
		<br><Br>
		<li><b>Why did you create this?</b><br><br>
			Hrrrmmm... Well, for one, I love narrative artificial intelligences and simulations and what not. I've been doing stuff like this forever.  It just turns out that Homestuck and SBURB is just fucking RIPE for simulating.  It's full of RULES and RARE EVENTS and DRAMA and ALTERNATE TIMELINES like you wouldn't believe. And it's aesthetic is instantly recognizable yet also full of infinite variations. 
			<Br><br>
			The ulimate final push towards making this was reading the <a href = "http://archiveofourown.org/works/340777/chapters/551606"> Sburb Glitch FAQ</a>.  It presented SBURB as a glitchy piece of shit and I thought to myself, "Hey, *I* could make a glitchy piece of shit!".  
		</li>
		<br><br>
		<li><b>Can you modify the odds of X happening?</b><br><br>
			I'm gonna go with a hard 'maybe'. As a wise Seer once said,  '<font face="courier" color="#008282"><strong>LUCK DO3SNT 4CTU4LLY M4TT3R >8]</strong></font>'.  Although me being a Mind player is mostly a self-indulgent conceit, I can totally get behind that sentiment, and nearly every sim I've ever made has luck be barely even a thing.  Everything is cause and effect and decisions piled on top of decisions. Randomness comes out primarily in the initial condition of the sim (who are the players, what do they prototype, how do they like each other.) Once I implement the character creator, even that shred of 'luck' will be removed from the equation.  After that, Randomness remains in things like "does Jack find a bullshit weapon?", and "who does Jack stab first?" or, to a lesser degree, "does PlayerX finally have their mind snap after all this 'Jack' bullshit?".
			<br><br>
			So, when people ask me to alter the odds of something happening, what they are REALLY asking me to do is take this pile of Rube Goldbergesque machinations and get a specific result out of it. Yeah...I'm not even sure AuthorBot could figure out how to do that. Most I can do is "raise the threshold needed to confess romantically" or "keep players too busy to confess", if my aim is to change how often romantic shenanigans happen. Even changing initial conditions to make them more neutral to each other starting out doesn't matter as much as what actually happens in the sim.  And because everything is so stupidly complicated, things are hella full of unintended consequences.  Sure, I can make romance less frequent, but maybe that increases the odds of a total party wipe by a bunch. (Players too busy flirting are too busy to engage murder mode?)
			<br><Br>
			Just to make it clear: this is EXACTLY how I like it. Holy fucking shit is it amazing seeing how sessions go down when I have NO IDEA what will happen but also can trust it will all play out logically (even if some of the logic is hidden from the reader).
