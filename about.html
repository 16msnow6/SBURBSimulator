<h1> FAQ </h1>

<ul>

	<li> <b>How do I contact you?</b><br><br>
			  My Tumblr is <a href = "https://jadedresearcher.tumblr.com/">here</a> and apparently that has an email address of jadedResearcher@yahoo.com.
	</li>
	<br><Br>

	<li> <b>Is there a way to save/share my session?</b><br><br>
			  The "Shareable URL" link will always display the session you're currently in. If you send that link to a friend, they will see your same session!
			  <br><br>	<a href = "index2.html?seed=413612">Here is an example!</a>
			  <br><br>
			  Well...I mean, as long as I haven't updated the code any. If I'm adding features or squashing bugs, the url will go to a slightly different session. If it's REALLY important that your session is saved, you can always print the page to a PDF.  Most modern browsers have a "print to pdf" option inside the print menu. I've had success doing that.  Make sure your session is actually done, of course, or you'll be missing the ending.

	<li> <b>The simulation isn't working!</b><Br><br>

		  First, make sure your browser is compatible with HTML5 canvas images. Try the <a href = "oc_generator.html">OC Generator</a>, as it uses the same rendering engine, but on a much smaller scale.  If you see things like Interests and Chat Handles, good news: Your browser is just slow and is taking awhile to download the images, but it IS compatible with HTML5 canvases (the text is a canvas on that page as well as the sprites). Refreshing the page a few times should get the images into your cache and speed things up. If you see nothing but drop down menus and check boxes, your browser does not support HTML5 canvases. Sorry.

		  <Br><br>
		  Okay, if the <a href = "oc_generator.html">OC Generator</a> is working good for you, but the simulation still isn't: We have found a bug.  It could be a small bug that only happens in the one session (gotta feel bad for those players), but it could also be a huge bug that effects EVERY session for your browswer. Refresh the page a time or two and see if you ever see anything.  If you don't, please let me know what browser you're using (both the name and the version number) and I'll see if I can track that huge bug down. Also include the "Shareable URL" created at the top of your session.
		  <Br><Br>
		  You can probably still view the <a href = "index.html">1.0 sim</a>, though. And if you can't even see THAT, then we REALLY have a problem.

	<li> <b>No, I mean I think you broke the sim. For, like, everybody. </b>
			<br><Br> Shit.  I do that sometimes. Mostly it happens when I'm testing some complex feature and I manage to get IT working, but don't think to do more generic tests.  The <a href = "rare_session_finder.html"> AuthorBot </a> helps me out a TON by running a bunch of sessions at once, but even she can't help me find subtle bugs that aren't console errors. (I was up past midnight last night, for example, figuring out why scratch buttons weren't rendering anymore. AuthorBot hadn't noticed AT ALL. She is still the best. <3)
	</li>
	<br><br>
	<li> <b>I think I found a bug!</b><br><br>
			 I welcome bug reports (see above for how to contact me), but just be warned that not every bug is a priority for me. Or even something I consider a bug? Shenanigans are my favorite hand-wavey explanation for why things happened weirdly.  For example, on the rare occasion that a corpse texts someone, I just imagine them tragically texting their best friend as they bleed out from Jack-related stabbings. Of course, sometimes corpses are a BIT more lively than that, fighting bosses and corpse smooching other corpses. That's probably a bug.  Use your judgement.
			 <br><br>
			 When you give me a bug report, please include the "shareable url". This will let me review your session directly.
	</li>
	<br><Br>

	<li> <b>I think I found a typo!</b><br><br>
			 Okay, but, like, are you SURE it's a typo?  Is it a refrance (which is itself a reference)?  Or is it a character's quirk? This entire thing is an exercise in pissing automatic spellcheckers off. If you're sure it's a typo, feel free to contact me (see above for how to contact me).  For example, somebody pointed out that I had been spelling (and pronouncing!!!) "carapacian" as "carpacian". D'oh!
	</li>
	<br><Br>
	<li> <b>I have a suggestion!</b><br><br>
			Awesome! Let me know (see above for how to contact me), but just be warned that I'm sorta doing this as a hobby.  My primary target audience is myself (and a hypothetical past version of myself who wished something like this existed).  I might think your idea is cool, but be all like: "Yeah, but that sounds HARD! And...kinda...boring to actually code, even if it's awesome in practice?".  Obviously I'm not afraid of hard stuff if I made this sim, but pretty much every part of it has been INTERESTING to implement, you know?  That said, random people have had plenty of good ideas that have worked it's way into the sim.

	<li> <b>Did you make all those images yourself?</b><br><br>
			Dammit, Jim, I'm a programmer, not an artist. Wait. What was the question? Oh, right.  No, I'm not a particularly artistic person. You can find a vague credits page for images I found and used <a href ="sources">here</a>. Mostly I found SBURB character creator doll sets and turned them into something I could use programmatically.  My friend, karmicRetribution, massaged the images as needed to make them not so derpy.  The wings were a bit more of an original project, since I couldn't find any sprite sheet for them.  For those I fiddled around with canon images and sprites and tried to make them fit the regular sprites, and then karmicRetribution made them less jaggedy and off-center and less obviously canon characters. karmicRetribution ALSO made custom baby/grub sprites. And better non-godtier sprites!

	<br><Br>
	<li> <b>I want to help!</b><br><br>
			Awesome! I have a git repository <a href = "https://github.com/jadedResearcher/SBURBSimulator"> here</a>, but just be warned that I am extremely unlikely to use any non-me-generated code. BUT! This whole thing is under the MIT License and people can use it for whatever as long as they credit me.  Also...you should totally be warned that I made this simulation for speed of development, not ease of modibliity or ease of understanding for non-me-type-people. Good luck!

	<li><b>What is up with the AuthorBot?</b><br><br>
			I love her!!!  In addition to making my life so much easier, I am just fucking tickled to have this shitty AI assistant with it's own shitty oc image. It's beautiful.
			<br><Br>
				That said, sometimes she goes a little...wonky.  Sometimes the sessions she finds are weird and don't actually correspond to reality at all. (Like gushing about a player that isn't even in the session). Usually at that point I have to figure out where she's eating extra (or sometimes fewer) random seeds. If she stops making sense, drop me a line (see above for how to contact me.)  Shes's as much code as any of this, so is just as prone to bugs.
