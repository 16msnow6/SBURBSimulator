/*

need to brainstorm fraymotifs.
but I KNOW I want them to have bullshit random names vaguely related to what they do.

random list of aspect related words. kinda the way levels work, honestly.

want fraymotifs to USE stats other than power in a way simple aggrieving doesn't.

cause status effects like berserk. power based on my stat - your stat

relationships are indeed a stat.

if player dies in combat, make it an important event?
