<h1> Vague Todo List </h1>
Without making any promises (and in no particular order), here's a vague list of my future goals in relation to this project.  It's highly likely that at least some of the things on this list will never actually happen.
<ul>
	<li> Have a character creator mode. (Customize all players, and then let sim run)  I'm thinking of letting this be inspired by the Replay Value AU.  Let you pick a failed session ID to put your characters in, show you how it ORIGINALLY went down, let you replace the original players to try to do better. </li>
	<li>Make GodTier aspect backgrounds better. They are so bad.</li>
	<li> Have Trickster scenes. </li>
	<li> Joke squiddle sessions </li>
	<li> If jack is driven off by at least one god tier, he destroys the moons (one at a time).  players might stop him first, though. destroying moon kills all dream selves that aren't main selves.</li>
	<li> Actually keep track of relationships, so I can treat infidelity differently. all 4 quardrants and quadrant flipping</li>
	<li> Maybe more stuff with exiles or carapacians other than Jack/Mayor. PM needs some screen time</li>
	<li> Have a as-spoiler-free-as-possible Homestuck refresher page linked from the about page</li>
	<li> Have AuthorBot have a spoiler free page, and a stability page</li>
	<li> Life players get one free extra life. (and maybe can bring other players back, too) </li>
	<li> Doom players have two dreamselves </li>
	<li> more claspect specific events sylph of time does different things than a bard of time, for example.</li>
	<li> fanon claspects if/when canon claspects are unique enough in sim. </li>
	<li>Custom radio buttons for ground hog day stuff. Why don't they resize with the zoom of the window. Bluh. </li>
	<li> SHIPPING. CHARTS. Heart players keep track of it. Blood players could too, but they already have unique effects in the sim.</li>
	<li> SVG graph of player power over time (x is ticks, y is power) color coded. (Why are graphs so awesome? What is WRONG with me?) Could happen at end of session when MVP prints out. Or be it's own page. or something. would need to record power...okay, figure this out later.</li>
	<li>Rainbow drinkers?  Jade blood revives as one instead of using up a dream self? extra power</li>
	<li> Refactor graphis AGAIN to take advantage of hardware acceleration.</li>
