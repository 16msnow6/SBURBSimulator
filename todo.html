<h1> Vague Todo List </h1>
Without making any promises (and in no particular order), here's a vague list of my future goals in relation to this project.  It's highly likely that at least some of the things on this list will never actually happen.  Many of the things on this list have been influenced by the whispers of the horrorterrors (that's you guys, btw).
<ul>
	<li> Quest for creating your session's First Guardian. ('random' components) If sentient, First Guardian orchestrates their own creation. Can also spin off other side quests with good or bad intent, or influence them to scratch WITHOUT waiting for user input (not like, temporally, but other ways of recovering the session, like combo or yellow yard would be disabled.) Make them a GameEntity like Jack/Queen/King/WV/PM?</li>
	<li>AuthorBot CorpseParty Mode: Lets you look at the causes of death for players. </li>
	<li> Have a tiny server (Node.js?) and database/local file running parallel to main site,  all it does is log page counts, at least at first.</li>
	<li>Further upgrade AuthorBotJunior to allow filtering by classes/aspects.</li>
	<li> Have a character creator mode. (Customize all players, and then let sim run)  I'm thinking of letting this be inspired by the Replay Value AU.  Let you pick a failed session ID to put your characters in, show you how it ORIGINALLY went down, let you replace the original players to try to do better. </li>
	<li> Joke squiddle sessions </li>
	<li> If jack is driven off by at least one god tier, he destroys the moons (one at a time).  players might stop him first, though. destroying moon kills all dream selves that aren't main selves.</li>
	<li> Maybe more stuff with exiles or carapacians other than Jack/Mayor. PM needs some screen time</li>
	<li> Have a as-spoiler-free-as-possible Homestuck refresher page linked from the about page</li>
	<li> Have AuthorBot have a spoiler free page, and a stability page</li>
	<li> players can corrupt the CD to their own session?</li>
	<li> Void/Light players less likely to be targetted by bosses</li>
	<li> Life players get one free extra life. (and maybe can bring other players back, too) </li>
	<li> Give light players a boost to random outcomes. its too bad luck doesnt actually matter. (or to break the quote, it matters only for a very few specific things. everything else is cause-and-effect. Terezi knows how it goes)</li>
	<li> Doom players have two dreamselves (or some other doomey unique thing)</li>
	<li> more claspect specific events sylph of time does different things than a bard of time, for example.</li>
	<li> fanon claspects if/when canon claspects are unique enough in sim. aspiringWatcher was nice enough to collate a list of GlitchFAQ aspects and their tasks: <a href = "aspiringWatcherNotes.txt">here</a></li>
	<li> SVG graph of player power over time (x is ticks, y is power) color coded. (Why are graphs so awesome? What is WRONG with me?) Could happen at end of session when MVP prints out. Or be it's own page. or something. would need to record power...okay, figure this out later.</li>
	<li>Rainbow drinkers?  Jade blood revives as one instead of using up a dream self? extra power</li>
	<li> Refactor graphics AGAIN to take advantage of hardware acceleration and/or improve god tier rainbow effects.</li>
	<li>Consider actually having HP</li>
	<li>Make Reckoning not based on number of ticks, but on plot shit. </li>
	<li>follow glitch faq closer. <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z6qNmYVA2Kmv4JbbnUUOpcSQu3JvYr3Y_9IwnbFUYkw/edit#">aspiringWatcher compiled a summary here</a></li>
	<li> Make luck a stat as well as a thing.</li>
	<li>Claspect Metas-shenanigans, like reading GameFAQs</li>
	<li>Finally dedicate time to figuring out why grimdark font doesn't load, like, 75% of the time. It not loading kind of fits the "grimdark means difficulty communicating" theme, but it's annoying and it's a bug and that's all there is to say on the matter.</li>

	<br><b>Slew of Ideas brainstormed with: DestroyerTerraria/recursiveSlacker</b><br>
	<li>Have Bards passively modify the sim based on claspect. Bards of Light make what few random outcomes there are fall less favorably for players, for example. Bard of Rage decreases the flip-out rate. Etc. etc.</li>
	<li> Allow dear sweet, precious The Mayor to be a source of Drama. Sorry, The Mayor... </li>
	<li> More explicit Player machinations, not just flavor text during a land quest. Don't want to increase dialogue by TOO much though, in an average session. Shits already getting excessive. </li>
	<li> Re-enable multi-turn Queen/King fights. Allow small amounts of seeded luck to influence the outcomes, not just who gets stabbed. Maybe have a similar engine for Jack. </li>
  <li> Prince of Mind mind control murder mode bullshit.  </li>
	<li>Easter egg 1 player session (either space or time.)</li>
	<li> Ironic Zombies</li>
	<li>Adding a luck bonus to power checking. Luck players can roll twice and keep higher number? </li>
	<li>Bard players less likely to do frog breeding or save doomed timelines. Or ectobiology</li>
	<li>Knights of Minds basically never trigger. Maids of Minds make everybody less likely to trigger. </li>
	<li> God Tier suicides for players who can understand/manipulate SBURB. Some players only do it if destined to work. Some players do it no matter what (and some of them god tier anyways, but some just...die.)</li>
	<li>Heir of Void inherits an empty power stat, so paradoxically higher entry power level Bard of Void negates grimdark entirely (passively removes void, like horrorterrors). Maybe also makes MORE dialogue/quest text appear that would normally be skipped. </li>
	<li>Page of Rage has a murderMode threshold inversly proportional to power. Stronger they are, more rage they have.</li>
