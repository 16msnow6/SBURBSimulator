<h1> Vague Todo List </h1>
Without making any promises (and in no particular order), here's a vague list of my future goals in relation to this project.  It's highly likely that at least some of the things on this list will never actually happen.
<ul>
	<li>Further upgrade AuthorBot to allow filtering by number of players in a session. or by classes/aspects.</li>
	<li> Have a character creator mode. (Customize all players, and then let sim run)  I'm thinking of letting this be inspired by the Replay Value AU.  Let you pick a failed session ID to put your characters in, show you how it ORIGINALLY went down, let you replace the original players to try to do better. </li>
	<li>Make GodTier aspect backgrounds better. They are so bad.</li>
	<li> Joke squiddle sessions </li>
	<li> If jack is driven off by at least one god tier, he destroys the moons (one at a time).  players might stop him first, though. destroying moon kills all dream selves that aren't main selves.</li>
	<li> Maybe more stuff with exiles or carapacians other than Jack/Mayor. PM needs some screen time</li>
	<li> Have a as-spoiler-free-as-possible Homestuck refresher page linked from the about page</li>
	<li> Have AuthorBot have a spoiler free page, and a stability page</li>
	<li> players can corrupt the CD to their own session?</li>
	<li> Void players less likely to be targetted by bosses</li>
	<li> Life players get one free extra life. (and maybe can bring other players back, too) </li>
	<li> Give light players a boost to random outcomes. its too bad luck doesnt actually matter. (or to break the quote, it matters only for a very few specific things. everything else is cause-and-effect. Terezi knows how it goes)</li>
	<li> Doom players have two dreamselves (or some other doomey unique thing)</li>
	<li> more claspect specific events sylph of time does different things than a bard of time, for example.</li>
	<li> fanon claspects if/when canon claspects are unique enough in sim. </li>
	<li> SVG graph of player power over time (x is ticks, y is power) color coded. (Why are graphs so awesome? What is WRONG with me?) Could happen at end of session when MVP prints out. Or be it's own page. or something. would need to record power...okay, figure this out later.</li>
	<li>Rainbow drinkers?  Jade blood revives as one instead of using up a dream self? extra power</li>
	<li> Refactor graphics AGAIN to take advantage of hardware acceleration and/or improve god tier rainbow effects.</li>
	<li> custom dead graphic overlays for king and denizen </li>
	<li> Riddles???</li>
	<li>Finally dedicate time to figuring out why grimdark font doesn't load, like, 75% of the time. It not loading kind of fits the "grimdark means difficulty communicating" theme, but it's annoying and it's a bug and that's all there is to say on the matter.</li>
	<li>Have Bards passively modify the sim based on claspect. Bards of Light make what few random outcomes there are fall less favorably for players, for example. Bard of Rage decreases the flip-out rate. Etc. etc.</li>
	<li> Allow dear sweet, precious The Mayor to be a source of Drama. Sorry, The Mayor... </li>
	<li> More explicit Player machinations, not just flavor text during a land quest. Don't want to increase dialogue by TOO much though, in an average session. Shits already getting excessive. </li>
