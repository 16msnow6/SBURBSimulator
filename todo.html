<h1> Vague Todo List </h1>
Without making any promises (and in no particular order), here's a vague list of my future goals in relation to this project.  It's highly likely that at least some of the things on this list will never actually happen.
<ul>
	<li> Tweak frequency of events.
	<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(Grim dark, murder mode, session success/failure, etc.) I'm writing a program to help me do this. Remember that this will affect old shareable URLs. </li>
	<li>Take advantage of shareable sessions.
	<Br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(Isn't this a mystery??? This is actually what I'm looking forward to most of all. Thus I will be an enigmatic bastard, cause I don't want to talk it up too much and then dissapoint  everybody if it turns out to be boring or impossible)  </li>
	<li> Have a character creator mode. (Customize all players, and then let sim run) </li>
	<li>Make GodTier aspect backgrounds better. They are so bad.</li>
	<li> Have Trickster scenes. </li>
	<li> Joke squiddle sessions </li>
	<li> Upgraded hair sprites (karmicRetribution is helping me with this) </li>
	<li> Obligatory highly indulgent author self-insert. </li>
	<li> Actually keep track of relationships, so I can treat infidelity differently.</li>
	<li> Thought/speech bubbles for Jack or other non-romance dialogue</li>
	<li> Jack stab corpse images (little knives sticking out) </li>
	<li> Maybe more stuff with exiles or carapacians other than Jack/Mayorl. PM needs some screen time</li>


</ul>
