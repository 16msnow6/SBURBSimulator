<h1> Definitely well-hidden Easter Eggs. (Mini-Update for 4/13/17)</h1>
<p> Easter eggs can be combined as such: 'index2.html?seed=SEEDID&lollipop=true&sbajifier=true'.  Start with a question mark after index2.html, and then for each new easter egg have an ampersand.  Here there be dragons. These are easter eggs, not main features. Shit can get weird.  I want to stress that each of these easter eggs are 100% modifiers to the real sessions. You can look at a session where everybody died and add a lollipop to it to see if it makes things better. One big exception is the seed easter eggs, like 612 or 413. These easter eggs straight up override the native players (and create some wholesale if there aren't enough players). So there's nothing to compare it to.</p>

<p> Oh! And I'm trying to gauge the difficulty of getting here. <b>If you contact me (see FAQ) with the subject of "Definitely well-hidden Easter Eggs." you can give me 140 characters (plus a chatHandle or similar) and I'll post them on this page</b>, under the easter egg links. It'll be like a high score table. The first people to get here are more prominently displayed. I reserve the right to not post what you want me to if it's offensive or whatever, but I'll reply to give you a chance to pick something else.</p>

<p><a href = "index2.html?royalRumble=true">Royal Rumble</a>: Everyone is an Heiress, which means they have a biological imperitive to kill each other. Also, a much higher rate of fish puns.</p>
<p><a href = "index2.html?lollipop=true">Trickster</a>: Everyone enters the session at a stupidly high level, is in love with everybody else (except the heart player), has super annoying quirks (except the heart player) and instantly completes their land quests. You'd think death would be impossible in this mode, and you'd be right: Except for when the tricksters THEMSELVES go batshit. Holy fucking shit. Oh, and now Doom players are completely immune, not half-assidly immune like Heart players.</p>
<p><a href = "index2.html?babyStuck=true">BabyStuck</a>: Everyone looks like a Baby/Grub and is practically incomprehensible. Suprisingly cute, until the murders start happening, then surprisingly disturbing.</p>
<p><a href = "index2.html?sbajifier=true">SBAJIFIER</a>: The graphics fuck up a LOT. Terrible outline artifacts are included (really proud of that), sprite layers are rendered offset, and I allow the page to randomize its own css. But the simulation itself is still working as normal. Oh yeah, besides everybody being given dunkass quirks.</p>
<p><a href = "index2.html?robot=true">RoboStuck</a>: Everyone looks like robots. Their relationships are initialized to neutral, because as we all know robots are tin cans incapable of feelings. (AB said it was ironically funny, I'm not REALLY Robo-Racist, I swear!). They also get a small power boost because robots are superior. They also TALK IN A LOUD MONOTONE. And...they say 'BEEP' sometimes. (They cannot control the beeps.) </p>
<p> <a href = "index2.html?seed=413">Homestuck Beta</a>: The 8 human players, John all the way through Jake, play SBURB. Quirks/Character designs are approximate. </p>
<p> <a href = "index2.html?seed=111111">Homestuck Alpha</a>: The 8 human players, Jane all the way through Jade, play SBURB (i.e. post scratch kids enter first). Quirks/Character designs are approximate. </p>
<p> <a href = "index2.html?seed=613">Hivebent Alpha</a>: The 12 Alpha troll players (Kankri all the way through Mituna) play SGRUB. If they manage to scratch, you'll instead get to see Karkat through Sollux. Quirks/Character designs are approximate.  I chose 613 because OpenBound is Act 6, Intermission 3. Or 6I3. Closest I could come up with an arc number for it.</p>
<p> <a href = "index2.html?seed=612">Hivebent Beta</a>: The 12 Beta troll players (Karkat all the way through Sollux) play SGRUB. If they manage to scratch, you'll instead get to see Kankri through Mituna. Quirks/Character designs are approximate.</p>
<p> <a href = "index2.html?seed=1025">Cascade</a>: The 8 human players, John all the way through Jake, play SBURB along with 4 troll players. Quirks/Character designs are approximate. </p>
<p> <a href = "index2.html?seed=33">Nepeta Quest</a>: 12 Nepetas play SGRUB.  Has a true random 50% chance of either being Karkat and friends all dressing up like Nepeta, or 12 Nepetas all roleplaying as Karkat and friends. Basically, either everybody is olive blood, or they are their regular blood colors. Either way everyone has the quirks and trollTags of Karkat and friends.</p>
<p> <a href = "rare_session_finder.html?seed=030303">Guided AuthorBot</a>: Did you know you could pass  a seed to the AuthorBot? It will direct her to the FIRST session she looks at.  The SECOND session will be the natural child of the first (unless there is a combo session, in which case it gets wrapped into the first). In this way you can look at the 'geneology' of the sessions/frogs, and also take a gander at how the easter egg sessions (like 612) were supposed to be without my mad science. </p>
<p> <a href = "rap.html">Extended Rap Battles</a>: Okay, so, like the rap battles are just so amazingly shitty, right? And they only get even SHITTIER the longer I let them go on. So, you know, here's a page that's just the rap battles going on for much, much longer. It was the easiest way to test them without waiting for sims to run. </p>
