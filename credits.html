<h1> Credits:  </h1>
In a vague order by type, these are the Fans who submitted ideas, writing snippets, bug reports, etc. If you want to submit a SBURB SIM generated sprite as an avatar (KR says: "We need to keep our terrible aesthetic consistent."), shoot me an email.  If you want me to not credit you, change how I credit you, or if you think you should be credited and I missed you, shoot me an email.
<br><br>Just because somebody hands me something doesn't mean it'll make it's way into the sim, but I appreciate it all the same. Thanks, guys!!!
