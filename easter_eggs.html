<h1> Definitely well-hidden Easter Eggs. </h1>
<p> Easter eggs can be combined as such: 'index2.html?seed=SEEDID&lollipop=true&sbajifier=true'.  Start with a question mark after index2.html, and then for each new easter egg have an ampersand.  Here there be dragons. These are easter eggs, not main features. Shit can get weird.</p>

<p><a href = "index2.html?royalRumble=true">Royal Rumble</a>: Everyone is an Heiress, which means they have a biological imperitive to kill each other. Also, a much higher rate of fish puns.</p>
<p><a href = "index2.html?lollipop=true">Trickster</a>: Everyone enters the session at max level, is in love with everybody else (except the heart player), has super annoying quirks (except the heart player) and instantly completes their land quests. You'd think death would be impossible in this mode, and you'd be right: Except for when the tricksters THEMSELVES go batshit. Holy fucking shit.</p>
<p><a href = "index2.html?babyStuck=true">BabyStuck</a>: Everyone looks like a Baby/Grub and is practically incomprehensible. Suprisingly cute, until the murders start happening, then surprisingly disturbing.</p>
