<h1> Bug Reports/Glitch FAQ </h1><h3>the most entertaining/fucked up things I've done in my quest to make the most stupidly complicated javascript program of all time.</h3><Br>

The wiggler version of the Mage of Time is under my/The Observer's influence!? What the...apparently they are trying to stop Jack from getting the Black Queen's RING. Shit. How the hell did that happen!?  My YellowYard should only influence copies of a player, not the original....Okay, I'm on it.

				Shit. Um. Were you part of a combo session? There's a known bug that certain types of time travel in combo sessions instead travel back to the version of the current session that WASN'T invaded by players from an alien session.   So you should see some familiar players, but nobody from the first session.  Hold tight, I'm working on it.

					!!! Oh god! Oh god! I FORGOT ABOUT YOU GUYS! Okay. So. Don't panic. But you guys were an easter egg I made. God that makes me sound like such as asshole. But...like...I overrode some players to be more ...well...'canon'. It never even occured to me that one of the easter egg sessions would get hit with my YellowYard! There's only like 3 of those things and roughly a 2% chance of a YellowYard happening! Jegus! So....when you went back in time, my mad science modifications were no longer in effect. The players you saw were...who you are were originally? Shit. Besides the baldness. That's on me. I preloaded the easter egg players, but not the originals. So any graphic assets that weren't loaded just didn't show up.
					<Br><Br> Bad news is, I...kinda don't think that you guys are a priority? Fuck. I'm REALLY sorry, but there are SO MANY FUCKING THINGS ON FIRE in this massive pile of glitches and bugs, I just don't think I can justify spending time fixing something that only effects a max of 3 sessions.  Most of the bugs I fix effect thousands at a time, you know?  And hell, as I tweak and modify the sessions, odds are the YellowYard won't even be AVAILABLE to you guys anymore so....problem fixes itself? Sorry that doesn't actually help YOU, though.

			<li> Session: ??? <b>   proficientTyrant: PRINCE OF TIME, HERE, AND I DID WHAT YOU SAID AND SCOOPED UP THE GROSS, DEAD CORPSE OF THE HEIR OF DOOM AND HAULED HIM ALL THE WAY TO HIS QUEST BED BEFORE HIS DREAM SELF COULD DIE. AND HE GOD TIERED, AND EVERYTHING WAS GREAT. BUT THEN WHEN I TIME TRAVELED TO THE BLACK KING FIGHT...HE WASN'T GOD TIER. HE WAS STILL DEAD. WHAT THE CRAP??????????  </b>
				<br><br>
				That's...weird. Okay, hold on, let me check. I don't THINK I'm re-killing players at any point. Hrrrm... and there's the code for time shenanigans to actually bring them to life... What the hell is going on....Oh god. Oh my FUCKING GOD.  I fucked up. Shit. I was sending you into a stable time loop. You were God Tiering the Heir of Doom from your doomed timeline. So. Um. I guess he's still back there, sitting in a pile of corpses and crazy people? Fuck. That might be more tragic than when it was just you stuck there. Okay. Things should be fixed. Next time we do this (which doesn't help YOU, just alternate time line yous), we should successfully go to the NEW timeline and bring back the non-doomed Heir of Doom.  Thanks for letting me know!

					<br><br>
					Okay, well, contrary to popular belief, players cheating on each other or flirting around isn't a bug.  I'm not about to enforce common courtesy amongst players. That's not how I roll.  BUT, I am fascinated to hear that you want to kill everybody three times.  That...that is not normal.  Huh. Looks like you're part of a combo session? I wonder if my generated relationships is bugged for combo sessions?  Bluh, I just realized that I'm more concerned that you want to OVERKILL your former friends, than the fact that you want to kill them at all.

We Agreed To Have The Maid Of Space Go God Tier Rather Than Dying Forever. It Was The Strangest Thing, Though: After God Tiering Her Succesfully, She Just Sort Of Slumped Over And Was Unresponsive. Apparently 3 Other Timelines Had The Same Idea, Because 3 Copies Of Myself, All With Their Own Versions Of Her Corpse Showed Up To The Same Quest Bed Only For All 3 To Slump Over As Well. What Is Going On?  My Time Clones Are Confused As Well, And We Will All Be Facing Death Shortly At The Hands Of The Black King, So A Speedy Answer Would Be Appreciated. </b>
					<br><br>
					Huh. That's weird. It kind of reminds me of another bug I had. That shit was tragic. I can see that I'm still not re-killing anybody. And...shit. Okay. Slightly less tragic, but related to the 'bringing the doomed version to God Tier' bug. It turns out I was accidentally-on-purpose making hollow puppets of the corpses you guys were supposed to be God Tiering. Each timeline gets their own corpse puppet. But since you were godtiering a puppet, that did nothing to the original player. And the puppets don't exactly get up and help out once they achieve God Tier. I promise I had a good reason for doing that!  Okay, it should be fixed.

			<li> Session: ??? <b>  honestLawyer: hi I'm the Heir of Light And um Well You see as soon as all my friends were in the medium the reckonin started and we all pretty much died That's not fair   </b>
				<br><br>
				Well, I mean, some sessions DO have the reckoning start pretty early, but you should at least have a LITTLE time between entry and the final fight. Let me look into it.  ... Okay.  Shit. I WANT to ask you if you're a scratched session, but I guess the whole point is you have no way to know that.  But I managed to track down a bug where scratched sessions weren't resetting their timeTillReckoning.  So the reckoning would happen pretty much as soon as it could. My bad. The bug is fixed, and the other timelines of your session should be doing better now. Sorry!

				<br><br>
				!!! Shit.  Okay. Reviewing your session it looks like the problem is that you were a scratched session. Basically, your guardians played the game first, (they were teens, and you and your friends were adults).  And they took care of the ectobiology.  So...when you tried to do the ectobiology, too, you created...sort of....doomed extra babies?  Shit. That's just extra tragic. It shouldn't even be possible, if you aren't destined to do ectobiology, then the equipment shouldn't even be IN your session. I'll look into it. Thanks for bringing it to my attention!

				<li>  <a href = "index2.html?seed=58014">Session: 58014</a> <b>perceptiveReader: who the hell is she!? i am the page of rage and i entered a new session with the only survivor from my first session the maid of hope and when we got there....who...who is she!? that is not my friend! what fresh fuckery is sburb inflicting on my life! is she a clone? an evil clone!? why did this happen? </b>
				<br><br>
					Huh. Well, I mean, MAYBE she is a clone? I'm totally making clones of all players who enter a foreign session.  For time shenigan reasons, don't worry about it.  But...the clones should be kept in stasis until time shenanigans need them....they shouldn't be running around. Let me look into it.
					<br><Br>
						!!! Whoops!  Sooo....good news is, I have totally tracked down the problem.  Bad news is, have you ever heard of the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capgras_delusion"> Capgras Delusion</a>?  Basically...i accidentally sorta kinda gave all you foreign players brain damage. And...it made you THINK your former friends were all weird replacmeents when they weren't.  Turns out, when I was artificially modifying the clones to care only about each other (and not you original players), there was a sort of...sympathetic reaction and it modified you guys' feelings as well. So you thought the Maid of Hope was a weirdly familiar stranger.  If I HAD woken her clone up and shoved her at you, you would have thought she was your original friend.
						<Br><br>
					So....uh, while, as always, there's nothing I can do to help you, alternate timeline versions of you (and all players who go to new sessions) have you to thank for bringing this problem to my attention.

		<br><br>
		Huh.  I gotta admit, while I knew it was technically possible for two players to have not only the same claspect, but the same chat handle, I never expected to actually SEE it. And then you both level up at the same time and so try to use the same echeladder? What are the freaking odds? Thanks goes to qwedvj for bringing it to my attention.
		<br><br> So...like....I don't even know what to do here. Echeladders are labeled by chat handle. With the assumption that chat handles are unique within a session.  I could enforce chat handle uniqueness....but then that's picking a side as to which Prince gets to keep it. I could try to identify the echeladders more uniquely?  Bluh.  I'll fix this. don't worry.  (Also, can I mention how cute it is that the Princes of Time end up in diamonds with each other? Shout out to karmicRetribution for noticing.)
		<br><Br>

		<li>  <a href = "index2.html?seed=149309">Session: 149309</a> <b>burlyTrainer: uh... i am the bard of time and me and my friends were going to play this really cool game but as soon as i tried to do the kernel thingy the game crashed? what gives? </b>
		<br><br>
			Well, on the one hand, there are those who would argue that the only way to win SBURB is to not play at all...but I can see how a session so bugged it crashes might be a problem for causality. Let's see.... Wait. What the fuck!? So... you are the result of a SGRUB session that got a yellow yard, then scratched, then invaded another session (this time SBURB), then scratched again.  No fucking WONDER you're bugged to hell and back. Shit's complicated. Okay. Don't panic. I've got this.
			<br><Br>
			Huh, that's really weird. It looks like the SGRUB session handled their ectobiology before scratching...but then in the SBURB session they were created there as well?  Shit doesn't make sense, but ALSO would explain why doom got EVERYWHERE after that. Oh!  Okay, this is my fault. It turns out I'm setting the ectobiologicalSource for the current players, but NOT THEIR GUARDIANS, and so the game tried to create the troll guardians a second time (which also of course recreated THEIR guardians, which already had an ectobiologicalSource) and everything just sort of spiraled out of control after that.  I'm frankly amazed things didn't break until a second scratch.  The straw that broke the hoofbeasts's back turned out to be the fact that the troll guardians weren't REALLY supposed to be in your scratched session, and so the game just sort of gave up rather than trying to figure them out. (Who the fuck are these douchebags?)

		<li>  <a href = "index2.html?seed=221777">Session: 221777</a> <b>majorHumorist: oH ShIt oH CrAp wE ArE AlL FuCkEd wE ArE AlL So aBsOlUtElY FuCkEd wE WeRe pLaYiNg tHe gAmE AnD EvErYtHiNg sUcKeD AnD We dIeD AnD ThEn sUdDeNlY We wErE BaCk aT ThE BeGiNiNg eVeRyThInG StArTeD OvEr bUt hAlF Of uS ArE StIlL DeAd aNd tHe oThEr hAlF Is cRaZy aNd oH GoD MaYbE I ShOuLd jUsT KiLl eVeRyBoDy  </b>
		<br><br>
			Oh.  Fuck. Well, this is a good example of why the fuck I was cloning the players foreign to a session just in case of time shenanigans.  This is what happens when I DON'T.  Or rather, you are scratched players. Aaaand...when I did a YellowYard on you, you didn't reset, even though your session did. So you entered the session with full memory of how fucking fucked you were, flipping your shit and trying to murder each other and everything.<br><Br>
			I'm left with a dillema here. Part of the reason why scratched sessions go slightly differently than non-scratched sessions is they don't have to use seeds to re-generate players. So anything relying on randomness will play out slightly differently.   I can either clone the players post-scratch as well (with all the added complexity and Capgras Delusions that risks), or...I can make scratched sessions slightly more...reliable?  I could let the scatched sessions differ ONLY by who is playing in them, which, I mean, that kind of makes sense. Have the random stuff be the 'same' (even then, it probably won't be because differently players will do things differently, which will effect the seeds that way).  Bluh, I'm getting to technical. Don't worry, I got this.

		<br><br>
			Huh.
			<Br><br> I thought I fucking fixed this already. Bluh, looks like the ever growing pile of glitches doesn't stop from getting taller.  Oh look, ectobiologicalSource stopped getting set for Guardians. Again. Bam. There you go, fixed. I swear to god, ectobiologicalSource better fucking STAY fixed or I will do an acrobatic pirouette of the handle and upgrade the AuthorBot to help me debug these stupidly convoluted sessions.  And current me is fully aware of how terrible an idea that is because these types of sessions just DO NOT FUCKING END. Current me is practically getting caught in infinite loops trying to debug it. Dear sweet precious, sweet, sweet AuthorBot would be lost forever if she tried to navigate them.

Not only is your very existance some sort of cruel joke, but you get like double the bugs of any other session. Okay. Well, the good news is that your guardians exist, so that you exist again.  The bad news is that I half-assed fixing it, so for now (at least), scratches are gonna be broken for you. Congrats!

			<br><br>
			Ordinarily I try to focus on the "leaves players to horrible fates" kind of bugs. But HOLY FUCKING SHIT, do I HATE how PNGs implemented gamma. Half the pngs I use are ...just....LOUSY with gamma. And it fucking turns out that not all browsers render gamma the same way. And SO, my code, which is looking for SPECIFIC FUCKING COLORS, can't find those colors in some browsers, some of the time. Luckily, I've figured out how to just fucking strip the gamma outta pngs.  As long as I remember to do it. Even if I think I don't need to.  So, yes, you are correct, prince hat-dealy thingies (you know, the tiaras?) were not getting their colors replaced correctly, and so were stuck in the default color of "Light".  It's fixed. And I sincerely regret that you guys are stuck forever in a shitty doomed session, but at least alternate versions of you don't have to do it with an eyesore.

*JR is surprised and excited to get a 12xBugReport Combo* Wow!!!  I guess I have no choice but to actually buckle down and fix your broken easter egg session, instead of just passing it on to future JR.

Hrrrm… AC11 (Hi Sollux!!!) definitely has a point. I only check for easter egg sessions when the page loads, not when a scratch happens. But I ALSO wasn’t actually making the guardians (you guys) right.  If I had let you actually get created, you would have not recognized each other as soon as you got into the session, and that turns out to be traumatizing enough to crash the session. For...reasons.  So I made the conscious decision to let you not exist as players. Especially since at the time, your Guardians weren’t actually failing at the session, and so you guys never even had a chance to find out you didn’t actually exist.

But, I went and added the new guardian system to the easter egg code, and you should be able to enter the session without insta-trauma.   Your 12x Roleplay combo was the push I needed to finally not be a massively lazy piece of shit.   The fix should even work for the other easter egg sessions.

Also, about the other bug. Well. When I first started Nepeta Quest, the 12 Nepeta Easter Egg Session, I decided that I didn’t want a boring session full of identical trolls. So, my original way of doing things was just to let the nepetas overwrite the original players, but only superficially? That way they’d all be different, like a bunch of nepetas all roleplaying as the original players.  But if there were less than 12 players in the session, I’d create fresh players, and figured shoving a random easter egg troll into the slot would keep them from all being the same.

Somehow….apparently all 12 players were being created via the second way. So all of you were very noticeably the 12 easter egg trolls, and not the original players. Whatever. I declare this “canon”. 12 dead nepetas, all roleplaying as their friends, or 12 easter egg trolls all (badly) roleplaying as nepeta. Both are canon, simultaneously. I love it.  Basically the only thing that changes is either all the trolls have Olive blood, or they have the entire rainbow of blood, coresponding to which easter egg troll they are.
