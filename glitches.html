				Shit. Um. Were you part of a combo session? There's a known bug that certain types of time travel in combo sessions instead travel back to the version of the current session that WASN'T invaded by players from an alien session.   So you should see some familiar players, but nobody from the first session.  Hold tight, I'm working on it.

					!!! Oh god! Oh god! I FORGOT ABOUT YOU GUYS! Okay. So. Don't panic. But you guys were an easter egg I made. God that makes me sound like such as asshole. But...like...I overrode some players to be more ...well...'canon'. It never even occured to me that one of the easter egg sessions would get hit with my YellowYard! There's only like 3 of those things and roughly a 2% chance of a YellowYard happening! Jegus! So....when you went back in time, my mad science modifications were no longer in effect. The players you saw were...who you are were originally? Shit. Besides the baldness. That's on me. I preloaded the easter egg players, but not the originals. So any graphic assets that weren't loaded just didn't show up.
					<Br><Br> Bad news is, I...kinda don't think that you guys are a priority? Fuck. I'm REALLY sorry, but there are SO MANY FUCKING THINGS ON FIRE in this massive pile of glitches and bugs, I just don't think I can justify spending time fixing something that only effects a max of 3 sessions.  Most of the bugs I fix effect thousands at a time, you know?  And hell, as I tweak and modify the sessions, odds are the YellowYard won't even be AVAILABLE to you guys anymore so....problem fixes itself? Sorry that doesn't actually help YOU, though.

			<li> Session: ??? <b>   proficientTyrant: PRINCE OF TIME, HERE, AND I DID WHAT YOU SAID AND SCOOPED UP THE GROSS, DEAD CORPSE OF THE HEIR OF DOOM AND HAULED HIM ALL THE WAY TO HIS QUEST BED BEFORE HIS DREAM SELF COULD DIE. AND HE GOD TIERED, AND EVERYTHING WAS GREAT. BUT THEN WHEN I TIME TRAVELED TO THE BLACK KING FIGHT...HE WASN'T GOD TIER. HE WAS STILL DEAD. WHAT THE CRAP??????????  </b>
				<br><br>
				That's...weird. Okay, hold on, let me check. I don't THINK I'm re-killing players at any point. Hrrrm... and there's the code for time shenanigans to actually bring them to life... What the hell is going on....Oh god. Oh my FUCKING GOD.  I fucked up. Shit. I was sending you into a stable time loop. You were God Tiering the Heir of Doom from your doomed timeline. So. Um. I guess he's still back there, sitting in a pile of corpses and crazy people? Fuck. That might be more tragic than when it was just you stuck there. Okay. Things should be fixed. Next time we do this (which doesn't help YOU, just alternate time line yous), we should successfully go to the NEW timeline and bring back the non-doomed Heir of Doom.  Thanks for letting me know!

					<br><br>
					Okay, well, contrary to popular belief, players cheating on each other or flirting around isn't a bug.  I'm not about to enforce common courtesy amongst players. That's not how I roll.  BUT, I am fascinated to hear that you want to kill everybody three times.  That...that is not normal.  Huh. Looks like you're part of a combo session? I wonder if my generated relationships is bugged for combo sessions?  Bluh, I just realized that I'm more concerned that you want to OVERKILL your former friends, than the fact that you want to kill them at all.

				<li>  <a href = "index2.html?seed=74881">Session: 74881</a> <b>scholasticTrainee: Greetings.  Seer Of Time Here. We Worked Together To Undo My Tragic Session???????????? We Agreed To Have The Maid Of Space Go God Tier Rather Than Dying Forever. It Was The Strangest Thing, Though: After God Tiering Her Succesfully, She Just Sort Of Slumped Over And Was Unresponsive. Apparently 3 Other Timelines Had The Same Idea, Because 3 Copies Of Myself, All With Their Own Versions Of Her Corpse Showed Up To The Same Quest Bed Only For All 3 To Slump Over As Well. What Is Going On?  My Time Clones Are Confused As Well, And We Will All Be Facing Death Shortly At The Hands Of The Black King, So A Speedy Answer Would Be Appreciated. </b>
					<br><br>
					Huh. That's weird. It kind of reminds me of another bug I had. That shit was tragic. I can see that I'm still not re-killing anybody. And...shit. Okay. Slightly less tragic, but related to the 'bringing the doomed version to God Tier' bug. It turns out I was accidentally-on-purpose making hollow puppets of the corpses you guys were supposed to be God Tiering. Each timeline gets their own corpse puppet. But since you were godtiering a puppet, that did nothing to the original player. And the puppets don't exactly get up and help out once they achieve God Tier. I promise I had a good reason for doing that!  Okay, it should be fixed.

			<li> Session: ??? <b>  honestLawyer: hi I'm the Heir of Light And um Well You see as soon as all my friends were in the medium the reckonin started and we all pretty much died That's not fair   </b>
				<br><br>
				Well, I mean, some sessions DO have the reckoning start pretty early, but you should at least have a LITTLE time between entry and the final fight. Let me look into it.  ... Okay.  Shit. I WANT to ask you if you're a scratched session, but I guess the whole point is you have no way to know that.  But I managed to track down a bug where scratched sessions weren't resetting their timeTillReckoning.  So the reckoning would happen pretty much as soon as it could. My bad. The bug is fixed, and the other timelines of your session should be doing better now. Sorry!

				<li>  <a href = "index2.html?seed=238304244">Session: 238304244</a> <b>roughLupin: what the omg i was in the veil and there was all this weird lab equipment i pressed some buttons and the next thing i knew there were all these babies crawling around everywhere the weirdest thing was that they looked like me and my friends and our guardians which made their incredibly violent deaths all the more traumatizing a few minutes later is that supposed to happen oh yeah i'm the rogue of light</b>
				<br><br>
				!!! Shit.  Okay. Reviewing your session it looks like the problem is that you were a scratched session. Basically, your guardians played the game first, (they were teens, and you and your friends were adults).  And they took care of the ectobiology.  So...when you tried to do the ectobiology, too, you created...sort of....doomed extra babies?  Shit. That's just extra tragic. It shouldn't even be possible, if you aren't destined to do ectobiology, then the equipment shouldn't even be IN your session. I'll look into it. Thanks for bringing it to my attention!

					!!! You're from the "27-doomed-time-clones" session!  I'm a HUGE fan!  But...you're not the Mage of Time...let me review your session... Oh! You're scratched.  And..oh god. The wiggler version of the Mage of Time is under my/The Observer's influence!? What the...apparently they are trying to stop Jack from getting the Black Queen's RING. Shit. How the hell did that happen!?  My YellowYard should only influence copies of a player, not the original....Okay, I'm on it.
