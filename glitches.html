				Shit. Um. Were you part of a combo session? There's a known bug that certain types of time travel in combo sessions instead travel back to the version of the current session that WASN'T invaded by players from an alien session.   So you should see some familiar players, but nobody from the first session.  Hold tight, I'm working on it.

					!!! Oh god! Oh god! I FORGOT ABOUT YOU GUYS! Okay. So. Don't panic. But you guys were an easter egg I made. God that makes me sound like such as asshole. But...like...I overrode some players to be more ...well...'canon'. It never even occured to me that one of the easter egg sessions would get hit with my YellowYard! There's only like 3 of those things and roughly a 2% chance of a YellowYard happening! Jegus! So....when you went back in time, my mad science modifications were no longer in effect. The players you saw were...who you are were originally? Shit. Besides the baldness. That's on me. I preloaded the easter egg players, but not the originals. So any graphic assets that weren't loaded just didn't show up.
