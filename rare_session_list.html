<h1> Rare Session List </h1>
So, now that the simulation allows sessions to be saved and shared, it should be a LOT easier to debug.  Sure, before I could use my creator-style powers to FORCE a session to go a certain direction, but even I can't control the details (AND that adds uncertainty. DID I fix the bug? Or did I only fix it in this artificial debug mode?). BUT, I still have the basic challenge of FINDING these rare sessions in the first place.  Below is a list of every rare session I have found in my quest to debug this glitchy piece of shit.
<br><br>
Additionally, if any of you guys find rare sessions that have no URL listed (or a rare session that isn't even in this list), contact me and I'll add a URL along with crediting you.  My Tumblr is <a href = "https://jadedresearcher.tumblr.com/">here</a> and apparently that has an email address of jadedResearcher@yahoo.com.
<br><br>
Be warned: As I fix bugs or add content, these URLs might no longer refer to a session that matches it's description. I'll try to keep them up to date, but no promises.
